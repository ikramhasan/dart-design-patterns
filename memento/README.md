ðŸ’¾ Memento
-------

## Explanation

Real-world example
> Take the example of a code / document editor (i.e. originator), where whenever you write something, the last content is saved in memory (i.e. memento) so that you can get back to it and maybe get it restored using some action buttons or keyboard shortcuts (i.e. caretaker).

In plain words

> Memento pattern is about capturing and storing the current state of an object in a manner that it can be restored later on in a smooth manner.
